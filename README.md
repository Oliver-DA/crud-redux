# REDUX - CRUD

## How to run the app

First: go to the directory where the project is located using your terminal and run => **npm run start.**
this will start the react application on port 3000


Second: Open a new terminal, go to the same directory and run => **npx json-server db.json --port 4000**
this will start our simple api created with axios on port 4000.

 If **npx** does not work for the json-server try **npm**.
